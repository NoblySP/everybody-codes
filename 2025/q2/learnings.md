# Integer Divsion in Python
- `x // y` vs `int(x/y)` are not the same when dealing with negative numbers

- Note: `-5 / 2 = -2.5`

- `x // y` performs floor division (always rounds down).
- It rounds towards negative infinity.
- `-5 // 2 = -3`

- `int(x/y)` truncates the result (drops the fractional component) .
- It rounds towards zero.
- `int(-5/2) = -2`


# Complex Numbers
Python has native support for complex numbers. Use that.
